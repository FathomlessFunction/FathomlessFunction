You may call me Fathom. I currently work as a Software Engineer, and I have experience with an array of varying technologies! I have found that the technological landscape evolves so quickly that some of the things I have worked on in prior years are replaced entirely with other things subsequently! Hence, I am hoping to document some of my day-to-day knowledge here, such that I may look back on them.</p> <p>I'll include some key technologies that I've had prior experience with below. I'm looking forward to helping it grow!</p> A list of technologies I have experience with Programming Languages: Various, but the ones I feel the most familiar with are: <ul> <li>Python</li> <li>C#</li> <li>Java</li> </ul> The Cloud: <ul> <li>Azure</li> <ul> <li>Sentinel</li> <li>Logic Apps</li> </ul> <li>AWS</li> <ul> <li>EKS</li> <li>EC2</li> <li>Lambda</li> <li>Security groups, networking, logs, etc</li> </ul> </ul> Processes: <ul> <li>Test-Driven Development</li> <li>Behavour-Driven Development</li> <li>Scrum &amp; Agile</li> </ul> Containers: <ul> <li>Docker</li> <li>Kubernetes, Helmcharts</li> </ul> IaC: <ul> <li>Terraform</li> <li>Cloudformation</li> </ul> Automation: <ul> <li>Github Actions</li> <li>Jenkins</li> <li>Temporal</li> </ul> APIs: <ul> <li>Kong</li> <li>publishing APIs</li> <li>Automated pipelines to do the above</li> <li>Building APIs</li> </ul> Games Development: <ul> <li>Unity</li> <li>PyGame</li> </ul>"},{"location":"test/","title":"Hello World!","text":"<p>This is a test page</p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/2025/04/06/hello-world/","title":"Hello World!","text":"<p>Today I set up this website, using Github Actions, Material on MKDocs.</p> <p>This was very easy to do, and I especially love this blog section! In the past, I have briefly used both Docusaurus and Jekyll, but I came across Material when searching for alternatives and wanted to see what using it was like! </p> <p>The learning curve for this is significantly lower than what is required for both Docusaurus and Jekyll - in Jekyll for example, I've found I need to manage which documents are parents of the other using metadata. In comparison, this automatically generates a page structure, simply by looking at the folders and markdown files within your 'docs' folder! Very simple and easy to do, though I imagine perhaps this simplicity may come at the cost of there being less customisation options down the line.</p> <p>Regardless, it's great to have a little website and blog to experiment with!</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/04/06/hello-world/#todays-learnings","title":"Today's learnings","text":"<p>One small error I ran into was regarding the 'date' metadata for this page.
