# Welcome to my website!

I'm so happy you're here!

## A little background

Pleased to meet you! You may call me Fathom. I currently work as a Software Engineer, and I have experience with an array of varying technologies! I have found that the technological landscape evolves so quickly that some of the things I have worked on in prior years are replaced entirely with other things subsequently! Hence, I am hoping to document some of my day-to-day knowledge here, such that I may look back on them.

----

I'll include some key technologies that I've had prior experience with below. I'm looking forward to helping it grow!
